00 - Before You Code
    10/10. Easy enough.
01 - Hello World
    10/10. I used Jetbrains IntelliJ Idea Ultimate but it was the same anyway.
02 - Data Types
    8/10. I don't really like such specific data types because I have always used Python and NodeJS which don't do that.
03 - Void Methods
    8/10. As stated before, I don't like void functions or extra writing (but this is for good).
04 - Conditionals
    11/10. Exactly the same as Javascript does.
05 - Value Methods
    8/10. Same reason as 03.
06 - Loops
    11/10. Exactly the same as Javascript does.
07 - Arrays
    10/10. Same as Javascript except for the declaration style. I fixed a typo in the assignment, actually.
