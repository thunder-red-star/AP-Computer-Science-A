0) The base in a base-X number system is the multiple that each successive digit to the left is multipled by. We are "basing" a number system off of the number X.

1) Binary is the base-2 counting system that utilises only 0s and 1s as digits. We care about this because computers can easily do computations and store values in this format. It is the most elementary format for storing data (as a yes or a no, which makes most sense for the transistors of a computer processor, or a memory / storage device).

2) Starting from the right, we read each value. We initialize the output variable. If the digit is a 1, we will add 2 ^ x to the output variable, where x is the index from the right. If the digit is not a 1 (i.e. a 0), we will not add anything. We the scan the next digit to the left, repeating this process until we run out of digits. Finally, we will return the output variable.

3) We take the floor of the base-2 logarithm of the input, i, and store that value in p. We also initialize the output variable. Then, if the value of i - 2 ^ p is greater than or equal to 0, we will append 1 to the output string, and subtract 2 ^ p from i. If the value of i - 2 ^ p is less than 0, we will instead append 0 to the output, and leave i as it is. We will repeat the process until i is 0, and then return the output string.
