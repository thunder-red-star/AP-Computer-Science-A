		"We discovered that Java is significantly slower than we thought when creating objects, not creating hundreds of millions of objects when it could process billions of calculations a second. We theorize that this could be because creating objects and writing them to random-access memory takes longer than simply making a calculation (125 Î¼s to store 1MB of memory vs mere nanoseconds per calculation)",
    	"We expected to be able to exploit private v. public discrepancies to hack, but for the most part, they made their attributes private, so stress testing was all the hacking we could do"
      "Java also protects against stress testing to a limit by limiting the individual method calls to usable limits. Doesn't mean we can't use loops!."

		"We thought that authenticate should be a private method that other functions could use."
