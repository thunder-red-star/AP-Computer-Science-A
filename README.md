Most days, we will create a new file that stores all our work in Java for the day. The repository is mostly composed of those files, however, there are a few files that are not related to that. 

## Other files

`.gitignore`: Basically ignores junk files that don't contribute anything.

`README.md`: What you're reading right now

`.breakpoints`: What?
